# DataCamp_Certification
This was a DataCamp certification exam I did, there was also a presentation but this is just the final notebook I used.

All the information should be in the notebook with explanations. Main idea was to analyze the recipes and build an ML model to use.

I felt like the best way was to remove outliers and use an XGBoost model. I tried a few other combinations but it didnt work.

Let me know if you have any comments or suggestions.

Michael.
